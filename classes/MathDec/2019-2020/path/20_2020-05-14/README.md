# Mathematics for Decisions - 20th Lecture #

We end the part about ___Integer Linear Programming and Gurobi___:

We implement the Diet problem with Gurobi to introduce its basic methods, then we go back to the TSP, solving it with the Branch-and-Cut procedure we have seen in the previous lecture: to do so, we exploit _callbacks_ and _lazy constraints_.<br>

Here you will find:
- ___gurobi-diet___: a folder with the Python script to solve the problem and the lp format file that can be solved using Gurobi Command Line;
- ___gurobi-tsp___: a folder with the Python scripts for TSP without Subtour Elimination Constraints (SEC) and with SECs respectively; moreover, there is the original TSP example that you can find on Gurobi website.
