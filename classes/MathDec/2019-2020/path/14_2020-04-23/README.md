# Mathematics for Decisions - 14th Lecture #

Fourth meeting focused on ___NetLogo___:

We discuss about possible projects to do, maybe comparing Linear Programming and Integer Linear Programming with Agent-based Simulation. We talked about Squazzoni et al. (2020) paper, ___Computational Models that Matter During a Global Pandemic Outbreak: A Call to Action___ (you can find it [here](https://github.com/romeorizzi/romeorizzi.github.io/tree/master/classes/MathDec/path/minicourse-gametheory)). In particular, we focus on the seven modelling purposes described by Edmonds et al. (2019), reported in the last two slides.
In the second part of the lecture, we experiment with NetLogo, trying to develop our own model about Brownian Motion.

Thus here you will find:
- ___3c_NetLogo-Squazzoni-CallToAction.pdf___: few slides resuming Squazzoni et al. (2020) paper;
- ___ABMtutorialV1.pdf___: interesting tutorial that offers also a model about the spread of epidemic diseases;
- ___gas_brownian_expansion.nlogo___ : the model we started developing together during the lecture.
