# Mathematics for Decisions - 21th Lecture #

This week and the next one we are going to talk about ___NetLogo___:

If you watched Prof. Benati's lectures about game theory, you should have already seen NetLogo in action: it is used to model situations and several scenarios using agents-based simulation techniques, in order to analyze possible outcomes. During the mini-course you just had a look to what it can do, but why not trying to design and develop your own models?

In this first folder you'll find:
- ___10_NetLogo-Introduction.pdf___: preliminary concepts about NetLogo and three initial tutorials;
- ___NetLogo-6-0-QuickGuide.pdf___: six pages of basic syntax to start coding in NetLogo;w
