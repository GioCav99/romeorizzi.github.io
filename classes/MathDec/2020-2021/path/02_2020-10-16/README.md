___2_Linear_Programming.pdf___
If you have already attended an Operations Research class, you should know what we are talking about, anyway it's always good to recall the needed preliminaries for the rest of the course. Otherwise, if it's the first time you encounter these topics, these slides are particularly for you! Don't be afraid and let us know, so we can support and help you to acquire these skills. We define what is a linear programming problem, composed of variables, constraints and an objective function, and you'll discover the difference among LP, ILP and MILP. Then we introduce the Simplex method and the theory of duality. Finally, a quick mention to sensitivity analysis.

Let's start reasoning about some problems inspired by real-life situations, trying to formulate, model or solve them already.
