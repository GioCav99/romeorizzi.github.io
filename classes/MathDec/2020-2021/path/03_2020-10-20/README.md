___Worksheet2-COVID19-OfficePlanning.pdf___
The COVID-19 emergency has forced us, among other things, to reorganize ourselves and... our office too!
In fact, even if theoretically there are twenty PhD students and postdocs assigned to Office 2.22, now the maximum number of people allowed is 6.

Why don't you help us? ;)
