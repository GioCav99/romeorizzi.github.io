# Mathematics for Decisions - 1st Lecture #

Welcome again!

In this first folder you'll find ___two files___.

___0_Introduction___
What is "_modelling_"? When and why we do it? And what is "_Mathematical Programming_"?
In the slides you'll find the answers to these questions and what will be the main contents of the course.
Then we set our goals: _design_ mathematical models; _experiment_ computational and informatics skills; _find opportunities_ to get in touch with working and/or research environments; _connecting_ with professionals and disciplines for motivation.

___1_How_To_Install_AMPL___
We told you this is gonna be a practical course, and this is how we start: modelling problems with LP, ILP and MILP, using AMPL (Algebraic Modelling Programming Language). These slides explain how you can download and install the needed tools on your laptop. Since some of next lectures will be full of AMPL exercises, we strongly recommend you to do it. It's very important that you will be able to work on your machine. If you have any issues installing the software, contact us.
