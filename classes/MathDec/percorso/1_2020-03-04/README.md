# Mathematics for Decisions - 1st Lecture #

Welcome again!

In this first folder you'll find ___three files___.

___O_Introduction___
What is "_modeling_"? When and why we do it? And what is "_Mathematical Programming_"?

In the slides you'll find the answers to these questions and what will be the main contents of the course.

Then we set our goals: _design_ mathematical models; _experiment_ computational and informatics skills; _find opportunities_ to get in touch with working and/or research environments; _connecting_ with professionals and disciplines for motivation.

___2a_Basics_LinearProgramming___
If you have already attended an Operations Research class, you shoul know what we are talking about, anyway it's always good to recall the needed preliminaries for the rest of the course. Otherwise, if it's the first time you encounter these topics, these slides are particularly for you! Don't be afraid and let us know, so we can support and help you to acquire these skills.

We define what is a linear programming problem, composed of variables, constraints and an objective function, and you'll discover the difference among LP, ILP and MILP. Then we introduce the Simplex method and the theory of duality. Finally, a quick mention to sensivity analysis.

___2b_How_To_Install_AMPL___
We told you this is gonna be a practical course, and this is how we start: modeling problems with LP, ILP and MILP, using AMPL (Algebraic Modelling Programming Language). These slides explain how you can download and install the needed tool on your laptop. Since some of next lectures will be full of AMPL exercises, we strongly recommend you to do it. It's very important that you will be able to work on your machine. If you have any issues installing the software, contact us.
