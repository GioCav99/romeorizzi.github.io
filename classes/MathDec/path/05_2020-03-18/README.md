# Mathematics for Decisions - 5th Lecture #

Let's continue with the ___Modeling___ part of this course:

We implement in AMPL and GMPL the Workouts Problem and we discussed possible methodologies to do modeling:
1. If you can abstract every information from the text directly, go ahead!
2. If you encounter any difficulties, don't have any rush. You could try implementing a first version that works only for the given instance: you can mix the model structures and the data information, your first goal should be that the models works, only that. Once you obtain this, you can think about how you can improve your model. Are you using any numbers of that particular instance in the .mod file? Maybe it would be better to put them in the .dat file. Are there any unnecessary constraints or is there a way to reach a higher level of abstraction? Reason about all of these and more, step by step.
In the end, your model should be the ___most general___ as possible.

___Don't be scared by errors___: they in fact represent our chances to learn! Take them as opportunities.
