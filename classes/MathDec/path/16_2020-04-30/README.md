# Mathematics for Decisions - 16th Lecture #

We continue the part about ___Integer Linear Programming and Gurobi___:

We introduce the ___Traveling Salesman Problem___ (TSP), we model it with AMPL and observe the limitations with this algebraic modeling language. To solve it, we recall the concepts of _lower bounds_ and _upper bounds_ and we describe the ___Branch & Bound___, an exact method widely used in Operations Research.

Here you will find:
