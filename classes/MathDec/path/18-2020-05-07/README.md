# Mathematics for Decisions - 18th Lecture #

We continue with the part about ___Integer Linear Programming and Gurobi___:

We describe the ___Traveling Salesman Problem___ (TSP) through a _compact formulation_, we model it with AMPL and observe the limitations with this algebraic modeling language. Then, starting from Branch-and-Bound, we introduce ___Cutting planes___ and ___Branch-and-Cut___, talking about the ___Separation oracle___.

Here you will find:
- ___4a_ILP-TSP-Branch-and-Bound.pdf___: the slides ended during this lecture;
- ___4b_ILP-Branch-and-Cut.pdf___ : the slides started during this lecture;
- ___ampl-tsp___: a folder with some .mod and .dat files to solve TSP (without subtour elimination constraints and with a compact formulation).
