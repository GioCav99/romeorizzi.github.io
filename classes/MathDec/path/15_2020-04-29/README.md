# Mathematics for Decisions - 15th Lecture #

Now we start the part more focused about ___Integer Linear Programming and Gurobi___:

We introduce the ___Traveling Salesman Problem___ (TSP), we model it with AMPL and observe the limitations with this algebraic modeling language. To solve it, we recall the concepts of _lower bounds_ and _upper bounds_ and we describe the ___Branch & Bound___, an exact method widely used in Operations Research. Then we

Here you will find:
- ___4a_ILP-TSP-Branch-and-Bound.pdf___: the slides presented during the lecture;
- ___ampl-tsp___: a folder with some .mod and .dat files to solve TSP (without subtour elimination constraints and with a compact formulation).
