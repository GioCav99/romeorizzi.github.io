# Introduction to Game Theory (20 hours) #

___Course program:___
Game theory studies interaction between agents acting to achieve their own goals. Main results of game theory are widely applied in various fields of Science. In particular, it plays a crucial role in modern Economics. 

The course is divided in two parts.

In the first one (lectures by [Stefano Benati](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0004309/Curriculum)) the basic concepts of game theory are introduced and a knowledge of Linear Programming (LP) is assumed as a prerequisite (the student missing the necessary background in the theory of Linear Programming is advised to look at the slides [2a_Basics_LinearProgramming](https://github.com/romeorizzi/romeorizzi.github.io/tree/master/classes/MathDec/lectures/1_2020-03-04) in the lectures of the Mathematics for Decisions course).

_Modeling players’ preferences_: Utility functions and expected utility.
_Games in extensive and normal form_: Solving games by backward induction. Nash equilibria in games.
_Zero-Sum games_: pure and mixed strategies and the Nash equilibrium.
_Some classic games_: The Prisoners’ Dilemma, the Dating Game, Chicken, the Ultimatum Game. An application to politics: the median voter theorem. Repeated games.
_Simulation of Games through Agent Based Models_: the Schelling’s segregation game. The persistence of ethnocentric behavior.

The second part (lectures by [Sylvain Sorin](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/sylvain.sorin)) deals with strategic games and introduces the main concepts, such as value and equilibria. Several proofs of the minmax theorem based on dynamical processes will be provided: unilateral procedure in discrete time, continuous time and ODE, fictitious play in discrete and continuous time, replicator dynamics.  The relation with approachability theory will be presented.
Then existence proofs for equilibria and links between equilibria and variational inequalities will be discussed. Supermodular, potential and dissipative games will be treated as well as correlated equilibrium, leading to elementary existence proofs. If time permits, a short presentation of “stochastic approximation tools” will be done.

___About the first part: Game Theory supplementary material___

_Books:_
If you want to have something to remind you the basic of game theory, those short texts are fantastic:

- Ken Binmore, Game Theory: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press
Short but complete, it covers the most advanced topics, such as Bayesian games, game dynamics, and so on.

- Brian Skyrms, The Stug Hunt and the Evolution of Social Contract, Cambridge University Press
Written by a philosopher that understand mathematics, it is a clear game theoretic and mathematical explanation about how and why societies have evolved.

- Herbert Gintis, Game Theory Evolving: A Problem Centered Evolution, Princeton University Press
If you want to see more about the mathematics (but without forgetting the interpretation of the results), this is a full-fledged manual

_Papers:_
Just to introduce myself, this is a paper of mine:
The Benati, Chiari model is about how I have applied Game Theory to a very difficult didactic problem: teaching to worker students. When I present it, people have a great fun (even though it is just a working paper)!

Then, if you plan to make a Netlogo simulation:
The papers by Axelrod and Shelling (and the more recent paper by Hatna) are the sources of the Netlogo models that I have explained.
If you are worrying about the pandemia and feeling like applying some form of game theory the Squazzoni paper may help you to develop your project.
