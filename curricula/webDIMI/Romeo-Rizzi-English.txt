Romeo Rizzi was born in 1967. He received the Laurea degree in Electronic
Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano in 1991,
and in 1997 received a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics and
Informatics from the University of Padova, Italy.
Afterwards, he held Post-Doc and other temporary positions
at research centers like CWI (Amsterdam, Holland), BRICS (Aarhus,
Denmark) and IRST (Trento, Italy).  
In 2001, he became Assistant Professor at the University of Trento (INF/01).
Since 2005, he is Associate Professor by the University of Udine (MAT/09).
He has a background in Operations Research
and his main interests are in Combinatorial Optimization and Algorithms.
He is an Area Editor of 4OR and acts as a Reviewer for the
American Mathematical Society.
He has published more than 50 articles in a broad range of scientific journals
in the areas of Discrete Mathematics, Combinatorics, and Algorithms.
He has mainly contributed within the following broad subareas:
Combinatorial Optimization, Graph Theory, Computational Biology,
Approximation Algorithms, Parallel Architectures and Algorithms.
Prior to entering academics,
he has had teaching experiences in high schools of various profiles,
ranging from commerce, to technics (ITIS), to lyceums.
In 2000, he got national qualification for teaching in Mathematics (047A)
and in Physics (048A).
Even after entering academics,
he kept on collaborating with highschools and Sovrintendenze Scolastiche (Trento and Bolzano)
in initiatives related to the iOi (the olympics in informatics) at a local level.
Since 2004, he has been a trainer of the Italian team for the iOi
under commission from AICA.
Nowadays, he collaborates with highschools in Udine, Trento, Bolzano, and Cles
in initiatives related to the iOi.
Inside the University, and beyond his due didactics,
he has also hold a few PhD courses and other extra courses, both internal and external.
During his scientific career, he has opened and closed a few mathematical conjectures
and has been a visitor in Vancouver (Canada), Victoria (Canada), Scherbrook (Canada),
Grenoble (France), Paris (Orsay, France), Nice (France), and Newcastle (Australia).
Whenever possible he lives in Trento and Cavareno,
where he mountainbikes with his children.
