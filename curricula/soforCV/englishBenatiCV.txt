My field is Operations Research. I apply methodologies of operational research for optimal decision-making in scientific, managerial and public sector applications. I am presently working on new algorithms for data clustering, new models for the optimal stock portfolio problem, and methods for computing indeces of power in voting games. I have published some twenty papers in international journals.
